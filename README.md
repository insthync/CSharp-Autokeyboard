# CSharp-Autokeyboard

A Simple auto keyboard which will focus on selected application then add input as you set

##Each row you can set:
- enabled? : if you are not checked, this row will not run
- keys: inputs you want to send to selected application
- flood: time to flood inputs
- delay: delay in milliseconds before next input
- repeat: input repeat

##Another keys
{ENTER} - to send Enter button input
{F1}...{F12} - to send F1...F12 input
{UP} - to send Up arrow input
{DOWN} - to send Down arrow input
{LEFT} - to send Left arrow input
{RIGHT} - to send Right arrow input
